# Generated surface deltas

The wire contracts remain [0.2 surfaces](../handbook/reference/surface.md)
and [ADR-0012](../adr/0012-views-as-public-rest.md), as amended by the shipped
handbook. Only the implementation and responsibility changes follow.

- The app mounts generated modules and passes `{ db, caller }`; `caller(request)`
  is the app's own `resolveCaller(...)` call. There is no generated `service.ts`,
  `withCaller` framework or Better Auth wrapper.
- REST retains public `GET /api/views/<name>` with declared query input plus
  `limit` and `cursor`, answering `{ rows, nextCursor? }`. HTTP Triggers retain
  their own method/path; JSON bodies and path parameters form the Procedure
  input and responses contain its result. Errors remain
  `{ error: { code, message, path } }` with the 0.2 status. Cookie sessions cannot
  mutate across origins.
- MCP retains public `POST /mcp`, staff `POST /mcp/staff`,
  snake-cased View names on each declared surface, and snake-cased Procedure
  names per MCP Trigger. Its SDK loads only through a request-time dynamic import.
- HTTP/MCP Triggers declare exposure only. `mantle generate` refuses schedule
  and lifecycle Triggers; Cloud scheduling is a separate capability.
- Retained Admin features keep their 0.2 paths; #1477 decides the retained set.

Generated `rest.ts`, `mcp.ts`, `web.ts`, `paged/views/*` and `validation/*` hold
only the app's tables: routes, tools, pages, operation bindings, compiled input
checks and types. Request handling (matching, body and query decoding, dispatch,
challenges, JSON-RPC, web rendering, keyset paging) lives in the package's
`rest`, `mcp`, `web`, `paging` and `validation` kernel modules, so a runtime fix
ships as a package update instead of a regeneration.

The generated `validation/views/<name>.ts` and
`validation/procedures/<name>.ts` export `validate(unknown)`. View validators
also export `query(URLSearchParams)` returning `{ input, limit?, cursor? }`.
REST and MCP use the same generated checks, with no runtime schema interpreter.
Supported checks are types/unions and nullable, required/properties/additionalProperties,
arrays/items and length bounds, enum, local `$defs`/`$ref`, string length/pattern,
numeric bounds/`multipleOf`, and date/date-time. Integers must be safe; fractional
`multipleOf` uses a 1e-9 quotient tolerance. `const`, `oneOf`, `uniqueItems` and
object property-count bounds are refused, alongside other unsupported keywords
and formats. Defaults remain
annotations and are not inserted into request input.

Transport-facing `paged/views/<name>.ts` exports
`page(db, caller, input, { limit?, cursor? })`, answering `{ rows, nextCursor? }`.
Bare `views/<name>.ts` retains native row arrays and accepts app-validated input;
selecting neither boundary adds no validation or paging work to that query.
Authored SQL `LIMIT` caps each page, up to 500, rather than the whole cursor walk.
A pageable exposed View orders one indexed NOT NULL Schema column, then `id`
in the same direction (or simply `id`). Unsupported exposed ordering is refused
at generation. Internal bare Views can retain aggregates and other native SQL.
Single-row aggregate/scalar Views expose one page and reject a cursor.

Cursors reuse the Store's percent-encoded JSON keyset codec. Selected View
cursors include operation provenance; malformed, foreign and
null-key cursors fail with `INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILED`. They are opaque navigation
values, not credentials; authorization and row predicates run on every page.

## Mounting REST

`rest.ts` exports `rest({ db, caller })`, returning an async
`(request, env) => Response | undefined`. The app supplies its native handle and
verified Caller; requests outside `/api` fall through to the app. Public Views
use `/api/views/<name>`; HTTP Triggers keep their declared method and path.
Known paths with another method return 405 with an `Allow` header. All responses use
`cache-control: private, no-store`. JSON bodies and decoded path parameters
are validated together, with path parameters taking precedence. Bodies larger
than 1,000,000 bytes are refused; `content-length` is checked before reading.
A resolver's `ContractError` keeps its status (an expired token is 401 with its challenge); any other resolver exception returns a redacted 500. Cookie-origin refusals retain
`path: "request:origin"`; REST and MCP share the kernel check.

When the manifest declares ref Procedures, pass the generated `Handlers` as
`rest({ db, caller, handlers })`; the option is type-required. Handler dispatch
uses the generated Store, preserving the Procedure's authorization contract.
Publishing visibility belongs to generated SQL; the REST module adds no status
filter. The app retains ownership of authentication and its other routes.

REST native acceptance is runnable with
`MANTLE_NEXT_REST_D1=1 MANTLE_NEXT_BUN_PG_URL=<disposable-db> bun test tests/rest-native.test.ts`
from the SDK package. D1 uses local Wrangler on port 8998; the tests clean their
local state and PostgreSQL schema. No cloud deployment is needed.

## Optional web output

`web.ts` exports `web({ db, caller, origin, title, description, locales?, pages,
cacheControl? })`. `db` is the application-owned native handle, including callable
PostgreSQL handles. `caller` is a verified Caller or the app's
`(request, env) => Caller | Promise<Caller>` resolver, evaluated once per request.
The module dispatches public Views only; it never invokes Procedures or needs handlers.

```ts
import { web } from './generated/web.js';
const site = web({ db, caller, origin: 'https://example.com', title: 'Blog',
  description: 'Articles', locales: ['en'],
  pages: { '/posts/{slug}': { view: 'post-by-slug', list: 'posts', markdown: 'body' } }
});
const response = await site.fetch(request, env); // Response | undefined
const tags = await site.head(request, env); // HTML string, empty for unknown/missing pages
```

Page parameter names must exactly match the View's declared input properties.
Page and list Views must return the page parameters; list Views must accept empty input. Markdown
must name a textual output column. HTML remains application-owned.

`/llms.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` traverse each list's `nextCursor`; `.md` and head
read the current page View. SQL alone controls visibility, including publication.
GET/HEAD responses include content-derived SHA-256 ETags. Anonymous responses use
`cacheControl` or `public, max-age=60`; authenticated responses use
`private, no-store`. `If-None-Match` returns 304 only after current content is read.
Canonical URLs use the configured origin, independently of the request host.
The current implementation adds hreflang only for `locales[0]`; translation-aware
indexes and head tags are a follow-up below. Importing another generated entry
does not import web output.

Web indexes scan at most 50,000 rows for one sitemap and 5,000 for `llms.txt`,
across all configured lists. Skipped `.`/`..` path segments consume the scan
budget too. Output stops before exceeding 50 MiB of UTF-8 sitemap XML (including
its closing tag) or 1 MiB of `llms.txt`; a sitemap index can be added separately.
Each request also stops after 100 sitemap queries or 10 `llms.txt` queries,
across all templates. Small authored SQL LIMITs or many templates can truncate
output sooner. A sitemap index remains separate future work.

`head` normalizes URLs from the queried row's page parameters, matching sitemap
URLs; malformed paths, failed validation and unavailable rows return an empty
string. A NULL Markdown field answers 404. Errors and missing Markdown responses
use `cache-control: no-store`. A matching HTML page takes precedence over a `.md`
alternate, including slugs ending in `.md`; a Markdown alternate may read the
exact HTML candidate first and therefore performs at most two View queries.

### Web translation follow-up

The generated `web.ts` exists; integrating translated pages is a separate follow-up.
It will call `translationLocales(db, caller, parent, rows)` once per parent page,
using its batched SQL reads rather than querying each parent separately. Locale
availability must follow the same public SQL parent/translation visibility rules.
The follow-up will produce per-locale `llms.txt` and hreflang alternates from those
available locales. Canonical locale tags use `toCanonicalLocale` (for example
`zh-TW`); URL locale segments retain the 0.1 lower-case form (`zh-tw`). Site locale
order chooses the canonical locale. Canonical and alternate URLs use the configured
origin and the same row-derived page parameters as the sitemap.

## Mounting MCP

Mount the generated `mcp({ db: env => env.DB, caller })` handler in the app's
Fetch entry. It returns `undefined` outside `/mcp` and `/mcp/staff`. Install the
optional official `@modelcontextprotocol/server` peer when selecting MCP; its
transport loads on the first matching request. Pass `handlers` when ref
Procedures are declared, as for REST. Staff tools are listed only on the staff
endpoint, and publishing visibility belongs to the generated SQL.

The app resolves bearer tokens with `resolveCaller(request, auth, { audience:
new URL('/mcp', request.url).href })` (both surfaces use `<origin>/mcp`). The app
must also mount Better Auth's `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`
metadata route. Auth challenges point to that route. Presented bearer credentials
need the `mcp` scope; cookie sessions use the same-origin mutation checks.

Generation emits `mcp.ts` only for a non-internal View or MCP Trigger. These
manifests require the `@modelcontextprotocol/server` 2.1.0 peer when typechecking
the generated surface. Publishing alone does not select MCP; on a selected
surface its generated `publish_<schema>`, `unpublish_<schema>` and
`archive_<schema>` tools use the same snake-case naming rule, are staff-only
and take `{ id, expectedVersion }` through the shared generated validation.

The staff allowlist is `owner`, `editor`, `contributor`. MCP bodies are limited
to 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes). Resource metadata challenges use the origin of
`request.url`; behind a proxy, the app must pass a Request with its public
origin so the audience and metadata URL point to the client-visible service.

### MCP Apps

When a manifest exposes a View, generation also writes `mcp-app.ts`. Its
`planApp({ surface, html, uri?, title? })` embeds the generated catalogue in
reusable HTML; pass `mantleAppHtml` from `@aotter/mantle-ui/mcp-app` to retain
Admin's labels, row actions, conflict handling and en/zh-TW/zh-CN interaction UI.
It does not embed caller data. Use an async HTML loader to keep the UI asset
out of the Worker startup bundle:

```ts
import { planApp } from "./generated/mcp-app.js";
import { mcp } from "./generated/mcp.js";
const handler = mcp({ db, caller, apps: {
  staff: { resources: [planApp({ surface: "staff",
    html: async () => (await import("@aotter/mantle-ui/mcp-app")).mantleAppHtml })] },
} });
```

Resources are bound separately to public and staff MCP surfaces; public requests
never receive staff resources. Custom resources accept a `ui://` URI, `html`
(string or async loader), `renders` tool names, optional `appOnly` View names,
CSP, permissions and `prefersBorder`. Binding errors fail when constructing the
handler; a write cannot be an app-only tool. HTML loader failures return a generic
internal error; their exception, caller credentials and request metadata never
enter the response or resource failure log. Visibility hides tools from clients
without Apps support, and never bypasses the original caller or SQL policies.

Capability detection follows 0.2: read `initialize.params.capabilities` or
`params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities"]`; explicit absence
of the UI extension disables resources and app-only tools. Later stateless calls
without capabilities remain `unknown` and retain resources. Supported tools
advertise `_meta.ui.resourceUri` and `ui/resourceUri`; model-visible render tools
also advertise `openai/outputTemplate`. Results carry
`_meta["net.aotter.mantle/tool"]` so the App identifies the View it renders.
